body and brain. They also raise HDL (good) cholesterol in your blood, which may help reduce heart disease risk. VCO is oil derived from the
fresh and mature kernel (12 months old from pollination) of the coconut (Cocos nucifera L.) by natural without the application of heat,
which does not lead to alteration of the nature of the oil. VCO has not undergone chemical refining, bleaching or deodorizing and suitable
for consumption in the natural state without the need for further processing and it is consists mainly of medium chain triglycerides, which
are resistant to oxidation and the fatty acids present in VCO are distinct from animal fats, which contain mainly of long chain saturated fatty
acids. Virgin coconut oil is colorless, free of sediment with natural fresh coconut scent. It is free from rancid odor or taste.</li><br>
                  
                  <li style="font-size: 25px;"><b> Cook Safely at High Temperatures: -</b> - Coconut oil is ideal for cooking because almost 90% of its fatty acids are saturated, making it
                    extremely stable at high temperatures. This feature makes it one of the best fats for high-heat cooking, including frying. Saturated fats
                    retain their structure when heated to high temperatures, unlike the polyunsaturated fatty acids found in vegetable oils. Oils such as corn
                    and safflower are converted into toxic compounds when heated. These may have harmful effects on health. Therefore; coconut oil is a
                    safer alternative for cooking at high temperatures.</li><br>
                
                  <li style="font-size: 25px;"><b>Virgin Coconut Oil for Cooking:</b> Aashaan virgin coconut oil contains 51% of lauric acid which is rich in nutritional value and is great for treating viral infections, common
                    cold, and yeast infections. It also reduces weight and promotes good cholesterol. Overall, it’s ideal for cooking.
                    Coconut is an uncommon food in the Western world, with health-conscious people being the main consumers. Several populations around
                    the world have thrived for generations eating a substantial amount of coconut, and studies show they have good heart health.
                    When your body digests lauric acid, it forms a substance called monolaurin. Both lauric acid and monolaurin can kill harmful pathogens,
                    such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi.</li><br>
                  
                  <li style="font-size: 25px;"><b>Reduces Heart Disease: -</b> Studies on people in the Pacific Islands found that their total caloric intake included thirty to sixty percent from
                    fully saturated coconut oil. These Pacific Islanders have nearly non-existent rates of cardiovascular disease.
                    The present health scenario characterized by the highest prevalence of cardiovascular diseases demands the consumption of oil and fats
                    that can lower the lipid level in serum and tissues to sustain the human health. In this context, coconut oil is given importance based on
                    their medium chain fatty acid profile that could contribute to the healthy heart besides being a source of energy and fat-soluble vitamins in
                    the maintenance of human nutrition.</li><br>
                  
                  <li style="font-size: 25px;"><b> Supports the Immune System: -  </b> It is rich in lauric acid, a nutrient that supports the body's immune system. Virgin coconut oil (VCO) has
                    received much attention as a “healthiest oil in the world”, due to its rich amount of medium chain fatty acids especially 48-53 % of lauric
                    acid that could augment the metabolism, immunity, digestibility and ensure the sound serum lipid profile contributing to the healthy
                    survival.

                    the secretion of insulin, Note: This is not a free pass to eat a lot of sugar and other dumb carbs. </li><br>
                  
                  <li style="font-size: 25px;"><b>  Improve Your Dental Health: -</b>Coconut oil can be a powerful weapon against bacteria, including Streptococcus mutans, the bacteria in your
                    mouth that causes dental plaque, tooth decay, and gum disease.</li><br>
                  
                  <li style="font-size: 25px;"><b> Improve Brain Function: - </b>
                    The MCTs in coconut oil are broken down by your liver and turned into ketones, which can act as an alternative
                    energy source for your brain. Several studies have found MCTs to have impressive benefits for brain disorders, including epilepsy and
                    Alzheimer’s</li><br>
                  
                 <li style="font-size: 25px;"> <b>Help with Weight Loss:- </b> Even though it is a fat, coconut oil actually helps with weight losst The healthy medium chain fatty acids do not
                  circulate in the bloodstream like other fats; they are sent directly to the liver and are converted into energy. Thus the body does not store
                  the fat in coconut oil as fat; it uses it to produce energy instead. In one study, overweight or obese people taking 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of 
                  coconut oil per day for 4 weeks lost an average of 1.1 inches (2.87 cm) from their waists. Consuming 2 tablespoons per day is sufficient to
                  achieve health benefits.

                              cuticles and massage for a few moments. Do this several time a week for best results. </li><br>

                              <li style="font-size: 25px;"><b>Natural deodorant:</b>
                                while sweat itself has no smell, the bacteria living on your skin can produce undesirable odors. Coconut oil’s strong
antibacterial properties make it a great natural deodorant that contains no chemicals. </li><br>

<li style="font-size: 25px;"><b>Quick energy source:</b>
  coconut oil contains medium- chain triglyceride fatty acids, which are digested differently than the long- chain triglycerides
  found in most foods.</li><br>

<li style="font-size: 25px;"><b>Remove stains:-</b>
  coconut oil can be used to get rid of stains, including spills on carpets and furniture. Combine one part coconut oil with one part
baking soda and mix into a paste. Apply to the stain, wait five minutes, and wipe away.
 </li><br>

<li style="font-size: 25px;"><b>Make your wood furniture shine: -</b>
  coconut oil may help keep your furniture looking shiny and polished. In addition to bringing out the
  beauty in natural wood, it seems to act as a dust repellent. Plus, it has a pleasant, delicate aroma – unlike many commercial furniture
  polishes that contain strong fragrances </li><br>

<li style="font-size: 25px;"><b>What are the other health benefits of Virgin Coconut Oil?</b>
  It helps in removing wrinkles on the skin and promoting hair growth.
  Virgin Coconut oil contains the medium chain fatty acids and monoglycerides contained in breast milk. Coconut oil is the second largest
  source of lauric acid after breast milk, which can kill bacteria and viruses.
  Virgin coconut oil is an excellent tool for controlling diabetes as it accelerates the use of blood glucose in adults and increases insulin
  production. Coconut oil helps to reduce the bad cholesterol that causes common heart disease and increases the good cholesterol that
  protects the heart. It also builds immunity against diseases like cancer. Virgin coconut oil made from pure coconut milk without the
  addition of any preservatives can be used in the diet even by patients. For dry skin, massage with Aashaan moisturizing oil use daily to get
  rid of dry skin.

    <h3> PREGNANCY
    </h3>
  </div>
  <b><p>“Coconut oil contains large amounts of lauric acid, a powerful anti-microbial fatty acid that protects the immune system of the
    fetus and newborn. Pregnant and nursing mothers should eat coconut oil to increase the quality of the womb environment and
    breast milk” – Dr. Claudia Pillow (Modernmom.com)
    Have you ever noticed how much a coconut looks like a female human breast? (Insert immature schoolboy snicker here.)
    Probably not, but think about it – these miraculous fruits given to us by nature resemble the human breast for a reason.
    They contain life-giving properties for nursing mothers and their infants. Now, I know that not all mothers can successfully
    breast feed, but for those of you who have breastfed before, let’s admit it: it’s HARD WORK!
    The sore nipples and the painful engorged breasts, not to mention the aftermath – for those of you who have breastfed you
    know what I’m talking about here – the post nursing “droop.” All the pain and “droop” was worth it, but I wish I had known
    back when I was nursing how I could have supplemented my diet with coconuts to give my baby even more nutrition and
    protection.
    There has been a lot of research lately discussing how the environment of the womb can affect the long-term health of the
    baby with respect to autism, allergies, asthma, food sensitivities and other chronic conditions. Coconut oil provides pregnant
    moms with a vital combination of vitamins, minerals, fats and proteins that are so good for their babies. That’s also why infant
    formula usually contains coconut oil.
    </p></b><br><br>

    <li style="font-size: 25px;"><b>According to Claudia Pillow, PhD</b>
      “A healthy diet contains mixtures of saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats. The unique composition of human
      breast milk contains about 45 to 50 % saturated fat, about 35% unsaturated and 15-20%polyunsaturated. Lauric acid and capric
      acid comprise about 20% of total saturated fatty acids found in breast milk. Lauric and capric acid have potent antiviral,
      antibacterial, and parasiticidal (kills parasites) properties that support the immune system. These fatty acids offer the nursing
      infant protection from illnesses, viruses such as herpes and HIV, protozoa such as giardia lamblia, and bacteria such as
      chlamydia and heliocobater.
      Coconut oil is high in saturated fat (but not cholesterol since it is from a plant) containing about 50% lauric acid. Other
      components of coconut oil include capric acid, caprylic acid, tocopherols and tocotrienols. (Vitamin E lipids that act as potent
      anti-oxidants that can help maintain healthy cell structure and function). A study published in the American Journal of Clinical
      Nutrition has shown that lactating mothers who eat coconut oil and other coconut products, have significantly increased levels
      of lauric acid and capric acid in their breast milk, creating milk rich in health promoting nutrients. Coconut oil is easy for an
      infant’s immature digestive system to absorb and utilize. It also provides energy in the form of medium chain fatty acids to help
      the baby grow and develop properly.
      According to the research, when a lactating woman adds foods rich in lauric acid to her diet, the amount of lauric acid available
      in her breast milk increases substantially to levels three times the original level and nearly double the amount of capric acid. A
      single meal of coconut oil can significantly affect the breast milk fatty acid compositions for 1 to 3 days with the maximum
      increase occurring during the first 10 hours. This data supports the hypothesis that diet directly affects the quality of human
      milk and possibly the womb environment.
      Pregnant and nursing females store fat to assure successful lactation. Any lauric acid and capric acid in the diet becomes part of
      the adipose fat stores. The milk fat of a lactating mother is made up of these stores as well as her current diet.”
      What this means is that a mother’s diet while lactating directly affects how quickly she sheds pounds once she stops
      breastfeeding. And since nursing mothers especially need fat in their diet, the trick is making sure it’s the right kind of
      fat. Coconut oil is an excellent source of fat since it is a medium chain fat as opposed to animal fat which is long chain and
      much harder for the body to break down. Long chain fat stores will linger a lot longer on our thighs and hips than medium
      chain fats like coconut oil, which quickly convert to energy.
      This is why it’s so important for pregnant and nursing women to eat a healthy diet- one based on whole foods: vegetables,
      fruits, nuts, seeds, lean protein and raw coconut oil! </li><br>

        <h3>MOM & BABY BENEFITS
        </h3>
      </div>
      
      <li style="font-size: 25px;"><b>1. Diaper Rash</b>
        The first thing that comes to mind is diaper rash. Most babies suffer from diaper rash at some point in their young lives.
Coconut oil provides fast relief from the annoying and irritating rash! It nourishes and treats the irritated skin and acts as a barrier to
prevent further irritation from developing.
<br><br><p>How to Use Coconut Oil for Diaper Rash</p> <ul>
  <li>* Apply a generous layer of Virgin coconut oil on your baby’s diaper area after diaper changes</li>
  <li>* Make sure to massage in the groin area and especially in the folds of the skin where the rash first appears.</li>
  <li>* The coconut oil will treat and prevent diaper rash with its moisturizing, antibacterial and anti fungal properties.
  </li>
</ul></li><br><hr>

<li style="font-size: 25px;"><b>2. Cradle Cap</b>
  Cradle cap is a common newborn condition that affects many babies during the early weeks after birth.
  The condition is characterized by a dry, flaky scalp that resembles dandruff. Coconut oil really helps!
  
<br><br><p>How to Use Coconut Oil for Cradle Cap</p> <ul>
<li>* Massage Virgin coconut oil into baby’s scalp, focusing on the area that is affected by cradle cap.</li>
  <li>* Allow oil to remain on the scalp for at least 20 minutes. Using a baby comb or baby hair brush, gently comb or brush to
  remove the flakes.</li>
 <li> * Once you have brushed off the flakes, you can rinse your baby’s hair with lukewarm water.</li>
 <li>* Repeat as often as needed.</li>
</ul></li><br><hr>
